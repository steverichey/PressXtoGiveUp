STATIC STATE
[You lost a fight against a worthy opponent. ]
[Don't worry.]
[Eventually we all do.]


'LOSE' STATE
["Ma'am. He didn't make it. The brain tumor--"]
["Was he in a lot of distress?"]
["..."]
["The important thing is his suffering has now ended."]


'WIN' STATE
["Ma'am. I'm calling to inform you that he passed away. The brain tumor finally got the best of him"]
["Was he in a lot of pain."]
["It's hard to imagine what he was experiencing in his state, but he went with great dignity."]
["A true champion until the very end."]
