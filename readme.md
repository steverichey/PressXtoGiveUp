Click the game to start. Play with music (headphones).

This game is about fighting a bull. Change stance (SPACE) when the bull is near. Immediately pull up your banderilla (HOLD UP ARROW) and stab the bull right behind the head (HOLD DOWN ARROW). Run away (LEFT/RIGHT ARROW) whenever you get the chance.
